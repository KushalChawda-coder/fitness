To increase muscular indurance, you should engage in activities that work your muscles more than usual such as squats, push-ups, or jumping jacks. Muscular strength relates to your ability to move and lift objects. Itâ€™s measured by how much force you can exert and how much weight you can lift for a short period of time.';
